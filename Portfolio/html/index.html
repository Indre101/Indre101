          My name is Indre I am student at KEA and welcome to my page where you will find
          the projects I have done so far and information about my experience and some general facts.
        </p>

      <div class="Aboutme2 animationAbout">
        Few short sentences about me is that I am hard working, enjoy coding more than staying in the sun
        even though I am not that experienced yet, have a positive attitude and my good sense of humour is always with
        me.</div>

    <!-- About me -->

      <div class="textAboutme">
        <p> My favorite geeky joke is, that I am without make up like HTML without CSS and it is kind of funny how with
          time more coding jokes start to make sense.
          But obviously I did not go to study to be able to understand jokes, my motivation for studying was always a
          challenge to improve myself and learn something new.
          And coding escpecially always had a some sort of mysterious cloak that I was always interested to lift and
          understand.</p> <br>
        <p>
          So leading by my curiousity I went ahead and got in to the multimedia design education. So far my main tasks
          included coding, creating UX and testing usability and UX.
          I often find myself getting lost while researching the design ideas, that you can create just by using CSS and
          JS, since I myself don't have strong drawing skills,
          this ability of being able to comunicate what you want to achieve is very exciting, but at the same
          challenging,
          since I am still working on how to understand user behaviour, what
          is neccecary while creating websites and interactive elements.</p>
        <br>
        <!-- <p>I have great comunication skills, because my work experience was highly based on comunication and customer
          service. Though for the past few years I did not have a team to work with
          I can definately tell that the education had provided quite few group projects where I was able to improve my
          skills at being in a team. </p> <br> -->
        <p>
          So to summarize about me I would say I am a multimedia design student who is passionate about coding, creating
          UX and with great sense of humour. For more proffesional
