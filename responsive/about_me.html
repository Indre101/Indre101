      <p>The first thing anyone usually tells about them self is their name and where they are from.
        Well You already know my name and I am from Lithuania. I have a very good 
        sense of humour, which I know my friends enjoy. </p>
      <p>
        So that was the more personal things, but I am studying in kea because I thought it would be a great
        opportunity to reinvent myself. I did as well thought the study program was very appealing to me and
        I always enjoyed knowing what is going under the hood of websites and how it all is created. <br>

        not so much proffesionally.
