      <p>This page is dedicated to Saul Bass Organic style, his Typography, color scheme and a bit about Saul Bass
        himself. Here You will also find other usefull information about the page it self. </p>
      <p>Often You can find Saul Bass described as <em>The man who changed graphic design</em>
        it is quite a bold statement, but after reading and reshearching who is Saul Bass and his impact,
        there is no doubt about his importance in the graphic design industry.</p>
      <p>
        I can be honest in saying that I knew very little about Saul Bass. But apparently I was always seeing his
        work and legacy in graphic design. His beginning mostly was working with corporations and developing their
        logos. Such
        companies as
        AT&T, Kleenex or Bell are still using his created work, it just tells how timeless his style still is.
