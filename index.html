    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This page is dedicated to Saul Bass Organic style,his Typography, color scheme and a bit about Saul Bass
      himself.
      Here You will also find other usefull information about the page it self. </p>
    <p>Often You can find Saul Bass described as <em>The man who changed graphic design</em>
      it is quite a bold statement, but after reading and reshearching who is Saul Bass and his impact,
      there is no doubt about his importance in the graphic design industry.<p>
        <p>
          I can be honest in saying that I knew very little about Saul Bass. But apparently I was always seeing his
          work and legacy
          in graphic design. His beginning mostly was working with corporations and developing their logos. Such
          companies as
          AT&T, Kleenex or Bell are still using his created work, it just tells how timeless his style still is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saul Bass is mostly known though not through his work in advertising, but his graphic artwork for movie
          posters and the famous reinvention
          of movie title credits. Titles became a spectacle to be seen. Film reels with Bass credits were delivered to
          movie theaters along with a note:
          “projectionist – pull curtain before titles.” </p>
