        While doing research I came across <em>Hitchcock</em> font which
        was created by designer Matt Terich as an homage to
        the iconic lettering that so often appeared in Bassâ€™ title work.
        But I could not find the same style availabe either to implement through link
        or by downloading it. So I chose few fonts that look similar to the original typeface, that I used
        in my Project document.
      </p>
      <p> <em>Vertigon</em> is the typeface for the main headings and in case it does not load I have
        imported a google font, which I thought also is very similar to the Vertigon called <em>Poor sans</em>. So I
        really wanted to
        keep the autheticity of the Saul Bass style, since his typography was a big part of his movie poster designs.
      </p>

      <p> For body text, captions and other text I used <em>Helvetica</em>, since it fits in the same sans serif
        typeface family as others and it is easily readible. Also the clear and simple style of <em>Helvetica</em>
        compliments
        well the other used typefaces.
      </p>
      <p> I used relative font size unit em, for better adaptation when resizing the viewport. The sizes vary from 0.8
        for captions
        and short text to the headings where is size is 2em.
      </p>

          give the posters movement
          and tension.</q> -Joyce Yin</em>
